# Snake Game 🐍

A simple Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` module as part of a learning journey through Dr. Angela Yu's **Complete Python Bootcamp**.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview
The classic Snake Game involves controlling a snake that grows in size as it eats food. The objective is to grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

---

## 💡 Features
- **Smooth Gameplay**: The snake moves continuously with real-time direction control.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your progress with a displayed score.
- **Game Over**: End the game if the snake collides with itself or the wall.
- **Customizable Settings**: Change snake speed, colors, and grid size.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd snake-game
    ```

## 🎮 Running the Game

Run the snake_game.py file:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## 🛠️ How It Works

The game uses Python's turtle module to create the graphics.

Key components of the game:
- **Snake:** Moves continuously and grows when eating food
- **Food:** Randomly spawns within the game window
- **Collision Detection:** Ends the game upon collision with walls or itself

## 🔧 Customization

You can tweak the game settings by modifying the `snake_game.py` file:
- **Snake Speed:** Adjust the delay time in the main game loop
- **Game Area:** Resize the screen using `screen.setup(width, height)`
- **Colors:** Change the snake, food, or background colors by editing the turtle instances

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- **Modular Programming:** Learn to break the game into reusable components
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Use keypress events for real-time gameplay
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Create Snake, Food, and Scoreboard as classes
